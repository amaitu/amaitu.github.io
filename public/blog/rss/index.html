But if you just want a personal site without members, I&apos;ve found the best option is to run Ghost locally, and upload the rendered pages to a free static web hosting service. This tutorial will show you how.</p><h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3><p><strong>[Skip this part if you don&apos;t care about the limitations and just want to get to the tutorial].</strong></p><p>It&apos;s important to understand a little about how Ghost works. The backend keeps state in a SQL datbase, and is accessed by a JSON API. Assets, such as images, <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/">themes</a> or logs are kept in &apos;storage&apos;, which can be on the filesystem of the server, in an S3-like object storage service, or in a container volume/mount. The other part of Ghost is the frontend, which out of the box is a theming system that uses handlebars.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><a href="https://ghost.org/docs/architecture/"><img src="./..//content/images/2021/09/ghost-architecture.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to host a highly scalable ghost publication for free" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="889" srcset="https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/ghost-architecture.png 600w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/2021/09/ghost-architecture.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a><figcaption>Ghost architecture</figcaption></figure><p>Generating static HTML files from your locally running Ghost instance works for quite a few use cases, but clearly not for anything dynamic.

The following features won&apos;t work:</p><ul><li>Newsletters;</li><li>Memberships;</li><li>Post embargos;</li><li>Easy collaboration with others;</li><li>Anything else that requires clients to make a request other than for HTML/CSS. </li></ul><hr><h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2><h3 id="how-to-run-ghost-locally">How to run Ghost locally</h3><p>I run my Ghost instance using Docker, which means it&apos;s easy to update and is isolated from my OS.</p><p>If you haven&apos;t got it already, you&apos;ll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">install Docker</a>.</p><p>To pull down the latest Ghost image, run <code>docker pull ghost</code></p><p>You&apos;ll now need to set up a folder where you can keep your Ghost content, this is things like images, themes, and your SQLite database. For instance: <code>/Users/steve/stuff/ghost-content</code> </p><p>Now, to run the Ghost container, execute the following, but substitute <code>my-blog</code> with whatever you want to call your container (doesn&apos;t really matter what), and <code>/Users/steve/stuff/ghost-content</code> with the location of your content folder that you created in the previous step.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -d --name my-blog -e url=http://localhost:3002 -p 3002:2368 -v /Users/steve/stuff/ghost-content:/var/lib/ghost/content ghost</code></pre><p>You should find that Ghost has populated your content folder with stuff:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="./..//content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-22.10.11.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to host a highly scalable ghost publication for free" loading="lazy" width="882" height="110" srcset="https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-22.10.11.png 600w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-29-at-22.10.11.png 882w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>What your content folder should look like now</figcaption></figure><p>Now, if you head to <a href="http://localhost:3002/">http://localhost:3002</a>, you should see that your publication is running!

Let&apos;s call it <code>/Users/steve/stuff/ghost-static</code> for now.</p><p>From your <code>ghost-static</code> folder, run the following command. You&apos;ll need to change the <code>--dest</code> to path of the folder you just created, and the <code>--url</code> from <code>yourdomain.com</code> to the actual domain you intend on hosting the site at:</p><pre><code>gssg --domain http://localhost:3002 --dest &apos;/Users/steve/stuff/ghost-static&apos; --url https://yourdomain.com</code></pre><p>You should now see GSSG fetching a load of files and putting them in your static directory.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="./..//content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-30-at-09.52.57.png" class="kg-image" alt="How to host a highly scalable ghost publication for free" loading="lazy" width="1434" height="1470" srcset="https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-30-at-09.52.57.png 600w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-30-at-09.52.57.png 1000w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-30-at-09.52.57.png 1434w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This can take a few minutes</figcaption></figure><h3 id="uploading-to-the-internet">Uploading to the internet</h3><p>You&apos;ll need some kind of static hosting service. I think <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a> offers the best performance, ease of use and price, so I&apos;ll be using that. It&apos;s free for unlimited requests, bandwidth and sites, up to 500 builds per month ATTOW. You could also use something like GitHub Pages or Netlify.</p><p>Create a GitHub repo for your static site, then upload the contents of your static folder - by now this should contain an <code>index.html</code>, some <code>xml</code> files, and possibly a number of folders, depending on how much content you have.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%8Bsign-in-to-cloudflare-pages"><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started#sign-in-to-cloudflare-pages">&#x200B;</a>Sign in to Cloudflare Pages</h3><p>Go to the <a href="https://pages.dev">Cloudflare Pages site</a>, and sign in with your Cloudflare account.

After you sign in, select <strong>Create a project</strong> in the Pages dashboard.</p><p>You&apos;ll then need to point Cloudflare Pages to the GitHub repo containing your static site, after which you can configure some settings such as which directory it should point at.

To get around this, ensure you periodically purge your static folder before regenerating it.</p><h3 id="database">Database</h3><p>The database used by the official Docker image is SQLite, which is fine for our use case.

I use a sugar thermometer and if I see it getting much more than 117&#x2103;, I turn the heat off for a minute.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="./..//content/images/2020/12/12---Baking-9.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="My Ideal Fudge Recipe" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Bubbling fudge</figcaption></figure><p>As the fudge is cooking it&apos;s fine for it to look light and bubbly like this.</p><p>It&apos;s quite tricky to know exactly how long to cook for, so it takes a bit of trial and error. Roughly speaking after about 35 minutes, I&apos;m starting to test the fudge for it&apos;s consistency.</p><h3 id="how-to-know-when-the-fudge-is-ready">How to know when the fudge is ready</h3><p>I use the &apos;soft ball&apos; method. Again, it&apos;s something you&apos;ll get better at after a few attempts - but essentially you put a bit of the liquid fudge in cold water to see if it takes on the consistency you&apos;re aiming for.</p><p>Fill a bowl with cold water. Drop a teaspoon of fudge in - then pick it up. Can you form it into a ball that stays together? Does it have the consistency of fudge? If so, it&apos;s probably ready. You don&apos;t want it to go hard - that means it&apos;s been cooked too long. If the fudge stays very liquid and doesn&apos;t form a ball easily, then it needs more cooking.</p><p>Once the fudge is cooked, turn off the heat and mix in the salt and vanilla. I personally like to use plenty of salt, but err on the side of caution. You can always sprinkle more salt on after it&apos;s cooked.

But what happens when a customer&#x2019;s payment fails?</h4><p>It&#x2019;s natural that a proportion of payments will fail&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;customers&#x2019; cards have changed, or there aren&#x2019;t enough funds in the account. At Gousto we had a natural failed payment rate of around 2% for existing customers.</p><p>Until recently we only had two ways of handling a failed payment. First, we could send out the box anyway and put a debit on the customer&#x2019;s account. Alternatively, we could just cancel the customer&#x2019;s order.</p><p>Neither of these is a good solution. We never want to have to cancel a customer&#x2019;s box, nor do we want to put a customer into &#x2018;debt&#x2019;. The majority of failed payments are because a customer has forgotten to update their card details and are still expecting to receive their order. I&#x2019;m sure you can imagine how frustrating it might be to lose your food delivery for the week just because your debit card expired.</p><h4 id="how-did-we-reduce-failed-payments">How did we reduce failed payments?</h4><p>We decided to request a &#x2018;dry run&#x2019; payment 24 hours before the actual payment is due&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;this is known as a <em>pre-authorisation. </em>Pre-auths allow merchants like Gousto to &#x2018;reserve&#x2019; some amount of money against a customer&#x2019;s payment method, without actually charging them. When we attempt to reserve these funds, we&#x2019;ll receive a success or failure response from the customer&#x2019;s bank. If unsuccessful, we can ask the customer to update their payment details.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="./..//content/images/2021/03/pre-auth-flow.png" class="kg-image" alt="How we reduced our failed payment rate by&#xA0;92%" loading="lazy" width="1696" height="648" srcset="https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/pre-auth-flow.png 600w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/pre-auth-flow.png 1000w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/03/pre-auth-flow.png 1600w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/pre-auth-flow.png 1696w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>As you can see, pre-auths allow us to catch a failed payment. We then email customers and give them 24 hours to update their card details in time for the final payment. This alone reduced our failed payment rate by 92%!</p><p>Many customers will receive a notification from their bank when the pre-auth is requested, which serves as an extra reminder of their upcoming box, with time for them to update their recipes before it&#x2019;s dispatched. If the customer no longer wishes to receive their order, they also have the opportunity to cancel it through the app before it&#x2019;s already paid for and dispatched. This reduces wasteful unintentional orders.</p><h4 id="how-do-pre-auths-actually-work">How do pre-auths actually work?</h4><p>When a merchant <a href="https://www.paymill.com/en/glossary/card-pre-authorisation/" rel="noopener">pre-authorises</a> funds on an account, it doesn&#x2019;t have access to those funds yet; they&#x2019;re ring-fenced for that merchant to use at some future point in time and the customer can&#x2019;t use those funds for anything else.</p><p>If the merchant doesn&#x2019;t end up charging the customer, the funds are released back to the customer by their bank after a period of time, typically five days. We built our system so that if a customer cancels a box that has been pre-authorised but not yet paid for, we would immediately void the pre-authorisation. This ensures we aren&#x2019;t holding onto customers&#x2019; funds for any longer than is necessary.</p><hr><h4 id="how-did-we-engineer-this-enter-data-bulkheading"><strong>How did we engineer this? <em>Enter: Data bulkheading.</em></strong></h4><p>As I mentioned above, once a Gousto order is &#x2018;cut-off&#x2019;, it is no longer editable by the customer and is sent to one of our factories to be packed. This happens in batches of orders at a time, so it&#x2019;s extremely important that this process is fault tolerant and speedy. To this end, many Gousto applications use a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30391809/what-is-bulkhead-pattern-used-by-hystrix" rel="noopener"><em>bulkhead</em> architecture</a>, and our shiny new pre-auth system is no exception.</p><p>The pre-auth process comprises a series of <a href="https://medium.com/gousto-engineering-techbrunch/powering-the-supply-chain-with-serverless-architecture-part-2-323932bf4424">serverless</a> functions, but we don&#x2019;t want these functions to have to rely on a centralised data store to do their job. Instead, they have their own data store, which keeps a copy of all upcoming orders with payments due in the near future. Not only does this save additional functions from putting more load on a single database, but should there be a fault in another part of the system, the payments data store will be unaffected. Fun fact: the bulkhead pattern is named after the isolated sections of a ship&#x2019;s hull. If the hull is pierced, only the damaged section fills with water, preventing the rest from flooding.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./..//content/images/2021/03/container-ship.png" class="kg-image" alt="How we reduced our failed payment rate by&#xA0;92%" loading="lazy" width="1172" height="806" srcset="https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/container-ship.png 600w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/container-ship.png 1000w, https://sgbarker.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/container-ship.png 1172w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The pre-auth system is an ideal use case for serverless functions. Demand for these services is very spiky&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;when a batch of orders is &#x2018;cut off&#x2019; for example, we need a large amount of concurrency to quickly process them all. The rest of the time, we don&#x2019;t see much activity, so it doesn&#x2019;t make sense to pay for running servers.</p><p>For our payment functions to maintain a storage bulkhead, they need to be kept up to date with the state of orders. We utilise AWS SNS and SQS for this or&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;in other words&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;pub&#x2019; sub&#x2019;. When any application within Gousto makes a change to an order, we publish to a topic. One of our payment functions is subscribed to this topic, and if the change affects the price or payment of the order, this update is added to its queue. The change is then persisted to the payments data store, ready to be processed.</p><p>After testing pre-auths on a small group of customers for a few weeks, we saw very positive results, both financially and from the feedback we received from customers! We have now rolled this out to everyone who uses Gousto.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Ghost?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Back in the day I used WordPress quite a bit.

It had many appealing qualities - it was easy to host, very extendable and had a huge community of users. So huge that even in 2020, WordPress runs <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/">over 33%</a> of all websites. I used WordPress for all kinds of projects that needed a CMS: brochure sites, online stores, landing pages.</p><p>But even though WordPress was ostensibly a <em>blogging</em> platform, by 2013 it no longer excelled as one. The WordPress team had continued to add features, and with the extensibility of plugins and themes, WordPress became a much more general-purpose API for managing content on the web.</p><p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything intrinsically wrong with this, but it left an opportunity for a CMS narrowly focussed on the writing experience. And there was demand for such a CMS. <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> ran a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform">Kickstarter campaign</a>, and has been growing in popularity ever since.Ghost has a clean writing interface that uses blocks to arrange content, (similar to <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion&apos;s</a>, though admittedly not with as many block types), and makes for a very intuitive all-round UI. I&apos;ve made Ghost sites for non-techie people and they&apos;ve been able to get going straight away. That&apos;s not to say Ghost is lacking features, rather they&apos;re focussed on allowing you to write, grow your audience, and more recently, monetise that audience. There are SEO tools, email newsletters and paid memberships built in, for instance.So it&apos;s safe to say I&apos;m a fan of Ghost. I don&apos;t dislike WordPress, but for writing projects, Ghost is my no1. choice. It can be self-hosted, or you can use Ghost&apos;s official managed hosting.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moscow Mule Twist]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My take on the simple Moscow Mule cocktail.
